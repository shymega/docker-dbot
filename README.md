A Dockerfile for [dbot](http://github.com/reality/dbot)
======================================================

What *are* Dockerfiles?
=======================

Docker is a virtualisation platform - I'm **not** the best person to explain this. You have images and containers. Deploy a image to a container, and commit changes to a new image. Done.

Dockerfiles are what you use to *build* your images. In this case, I've used a nodejs base image to put dbot into a image.

How do I use docker-dbot?
=========================

It's really, really **simple** . 

Run ./install from the repo folder and the script will sort out the whole process for you. :-))
